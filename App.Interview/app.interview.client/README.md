# Interview Exercise - School Information System

This application is designed as a technical coding exercise for job interviews. It provides a simplified school information system that demonstrates basic CRUD operations and Angular development practices.

## About the Application

This is a simplified school information management system that allows users to:
- View and manage student information
- View and manage staff information
- Navigate between different sections of the application

The application serves as a practical assessment tool for evaluating candidates' understanding of:
- Angular framework and its core concepts
- Component-based architecture
- Routing and navigation
- Basic CRUD operations
- TypeScript/JavaScript proficiency
- Frontend development best practices

## Technical Stack

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.12 and includes:
- Angular framework
- TypeScript
- Angular Router for navigation
- Modern component-based architecture

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
