# Interview Exercise - FAKE SIS

This application is designed as a technical coding exercise for interviews. It provides a simplified school information system that demonstrates basic CRUD operations and Angular development practices.

## About the Application

This is a simplified school information management system that consists of both a frontend Angular application and a .NET backend API. The system currently allows users to:
- View students and their enrolled courses
- View staff and their assigned courses
- Navigate between different sections of the application

### Frontend
- Angular-based Single Page Application (SPA)
- Component-based architecture
- Angular Router for navigation
- TypeScript for type-safe development

### Backend
- .NET Web API
- SQLite in-memory database for simplified setup and demonstration
- Repository pattern for data access
- RESTful API endpoints

The use of SQLite in-memory database means that:
- No database installation or setup is required
- Data resets when the application restarts

The application serves as a practical assessment tool for evaluating candidates' understanding of:
- Angular framework and its core concepts
- .NET Web API development
- Component-based architecture
- Routing and navigation
- Basic CRUD operations
- TypeScript/JavaScript proficiency
- Frontend development best practices
- API integration and data flow
- Database interactions (albeit simplified)

## Technical Stack
